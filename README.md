# GitLabFall18
This was the an excercise on Git and my first experience with GitHub. 
Our Unix/C class was attempting to make a text based video game where a RNG
would assign them to a door, which was a specific classmates game. 

## My Game
Was essential pokemon style "Rock, Paper, Scissors" but instead using 
the three elements of "Fire, Water, and Grass".
